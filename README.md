# InventoryFrontend

Micro-frontend for inventory system for BarNone platform. Allows users to add inventory items by name, and displays inventory of items from BarNone backend in real time.

Future iterations will allow inventory items to be added by barcode, so that inventory can be scanned with a barcode wand upon arrival.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
